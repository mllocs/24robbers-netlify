        One of the very few vintage jazz bands in Portugal, 24 Robbers are well
        known on the dance-floors of lindy hop, where their swinging groove
        makes it hard to stop dancing.

        Though in 2015 when the band was first formed, it was meant for dancers
        only, lately 24 Robbers are reaching to way broader audiences from
        festivals to TV awards, from big stages around the country to more
        intimate private events.

        This international group, that truly appreciates the art of swing, is
        heavily influenced by such names as Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong,
        Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday and many other great stars from the
        1920s to the 1940s.
