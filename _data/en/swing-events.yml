        With swinging rhythms from 20's to 40's, 24 Robbers have been setting
        dance floors of vintage dance events on fire since 2015. Born out of
        swing jam sessions, organized for lindyhoppers, 24 Robbers have always
        seen swing dancers as their prime audience. While more than half of the
        musicians also dance, "dancability" is always a big criteria for
        choosing our repertoire and arrangements.

        24 Robbers have participated in several international swing events, such
        as Blue Skies, Little Big Swing, Lindy & Blues weekend with Lisa &
        Fabien and Solo Train.
